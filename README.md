# Duty_Calendar

This project is a python program that uses Google's Calendar API to access a particular calendar which contains data about the HA (House Advisors) to be on duty that night.
It automates what was previosly a laminated sheet of paper that HAs wrote on with dry erase marker and turns it into an automatic ecosystem which is run on a Rasberry Pi and can read what time it is, whether duty hours are currently in effect, who is on duty, and automatically display all this information with minimal need for user interaction.
